The Sentiment Analysis of Drug Reviews project utilizes cutting-edge deep learning techniques to extract valuable insights from user-generated drug reviews. By leveraging algorithms like Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the project aims to automatically analyze sentiments expressed in reviews, comprehensively understanding user experiences and perceptions.

The project involves several key stages, beginning with data preprocessing. This phase includes cleaning the raw text, tokenizing it, and transforming it into numerical representations suitable for deep learning models. The preprocessed data is then fed into a carefully designed deep learning architecture, trained on a labeled dataset of drug reviews with sentiment annotations.

During the training phase, the deep learning model learns to identify patterns and associations between words and sentiments, gradually enhancing its ability to predict sentiment labels accurately for unseen reviews. Techniques like word embeddings and attention mechanisms may be applied to improve the model's contextual understanding and performance.

After training, the model undergoes evaluation and validation using separate datasets. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall are computed to assess its performance and identify areas for improvement.
